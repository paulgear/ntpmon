ntpmon (2.0.1-2) focal; urgency=medium

  * Add dependency on python3-prometheus-client >= 0.16.0 to force use
    of backported version for focal and later.  This should fix IPv6
    support for the prometheus exporter.  I will no longer be building
    for bionic.

ntpmon (2.0.0-5) bionic; urgency=medium

  * Add debian/compat which seems needed to stop bionic builds thinking
    we're asking for compat 1.

ntpmon (2.0.0-4) bionic; urgency=medium

ntpmon (2.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Apparently I had previously tagged a version of ntpmon as v1.0.0, so I'm
    declaring this a breaking change, semver-wise, even though it probably is
    99% backwards compatible.  The remaining changelog is lightly edited from
    an auto-generated changelog from git history.
  * Added:
    - auto-detection of NTP implementation
    - chrony support
    - collectd support
    - detection of hours and days in "when" field
    - gnuplot-based scripts for loopstats and peerstats and intersection
      algorithm visualisation
    - juju charms reactive layer
    - ntpd system metrics (from "ntpq -nc readvar")
    - prometheus exporter
    - standalone parser for chrony statistics files
    - systemd service template
    - telegraf support
    - unit tests expanded and improved (still needs more work)
    - updated documentation
  * Fixed:
    - correctly detect when no NTP server is running
    - fix incorrect reversal of WARNING & CRITICAL thresholds
    - various display quirks and inconsistencies
    - code reformatted for flake8 fixes
    - report metrics in seconds rather than milliseconds, to prevent confusion
      when graphing
    - report survivors-offset-mean instead of syncpeer-offset-mean; more
      closely corresponds with old behaviour
  * Removed:
    - trace checks are now disabled by default, and marked as deprecated
